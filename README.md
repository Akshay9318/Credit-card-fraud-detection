# Credit-card-fraud-detection
With the rise of digital transactions, ensuring the security of credit card payments has never been more crucial. For this project, I leveraged logistic regression, a powerful yet straightforward tool, to identify and prevent fraudulent activities.

🔍 Why Logistic Regression?
Logistic regression is particularly well-suited for binary classification problems like fraud detection. It models the probability of fraud based on features such as transaction amount, time, and location, helping to distinguish between legitimate and suspicious transactions.

🔧 Project Highlights:

Data Collection: I used a dataset containing historical transaction data labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent,the dataset was provided by kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
Feature Engineering: I carefully selected features that were most indicative of fraudulent behavior.
Model Training: The logistic regression model was trained and tested, achieving an accuracy of 91.23% on the training data and 90.86% on the test data.
Prediction & Validation: The model was then tested on new transactions to identify and flag potential fraud, with promising results.
🎯 Impact & Learnings:
Through this project, I learned how crucial it is to balance sensitivity and specificity in fraud detection—minimizing false positives while catching fraudulent transactions is key. The experience has also deepened my understanding of how machine learning can be applied to enhance financial security.

💡 Key Takeaway:
This project reinforced the value of logistic regression for fraud detection. It's simple, interpretable, and effective—making it a great choice for anyone tackling similar challenges in the field of data science.
